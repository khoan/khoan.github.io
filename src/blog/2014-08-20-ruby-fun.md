ok, let's get straight into irb because REPL speaks a thousand words...

~~~ ruby
irb> %w_a b c_
=> ['a', 'b', 'c']
~~~

That was cryptic...try this

~~~ ruby
irb> %i_a b c_
=> [:a, :b, :c]
~~~

That save a whole bunch of keystrokes...how about this

~~~ ruby
irb> %r_a/b/c_
=> /a\/b\/c/
~~~

That makes regular expression with forward slash more readable...in fact there's a whole slew of them %: %q, %x, %

ok, that's enough fun for now.
