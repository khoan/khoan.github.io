Change my mind: Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. is the greatest economist of the 20th & 21st Century.

Lyndon LaRouche is vilified, because of his actions on a powerful idea of organizing our economic activities, as a species, around Sovereign Nation States. Wherein, abundant food, water, and power (e.g. electricity) are produced that meet the current, and future, increasing needs of the human population on Earth. The driving force, behind this increased productivity, lies in each citizen, of these Sovereign Nation States, through education, healthcare, transportation, music, poems, classical arts & humanist culture.

This idea of a physical economy is NOT unique to LaRouche. Such idea has been expounded, or practiced, by Socrates, Plato, Charlemagne, Ibn Sina, Thomas Aquinas, Dante Alighieri, Jeanne d'Arc, William Shakespeare, Nicolas of Cusa, Filippo Brunelleschi, Giordano Bruno, Jean Baptise Colbert, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, John Winthrop, Cotton Mather, Alexander Spotswood, Jonathan Swift, Johann Sebastian Bach, Mozart, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Matthew Carey, Henry Charles Carey, John Quincy Adams, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Henry A. Wallace, John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Lyndon LaRouche.

Is it, then, not noble, and humbling, to wish to carry the torch, the gift of fire, from antiquity, to achieve security, on Earth and Mars, in the next 100 years; thence, throughout our perceivable Universe?

So, change my mind: Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. is the greatest economist of the 20th & 21st Century.
