Time to exercise your citizenship rights. Here is my [Financial System Inquiry Submission](http://fsi.gov.au/consultation/submissions/) on Stability - Addressing too-big-to-fail

To David Murray

The enactment of United States of America Glass Steagall Act 1933, here in Australia, is merely a necessary first step to reorganize our economy to become physically productive. Anything other than the passage of Glass Steagall verbatim is less than useless. "Investment" bankers will have to find an alternative career in order for the rest of the economy to persist. With the passage of Glass Steagall, the unpayable debt burden will be greatly reduced; "commercial" banks will be recapitalized, via a national banking scheme, to fund projects that resolve our foreseeable shortages: water, food, electricity, education, healthcare, arts, space defense and exploration; our citizens will reclaim the dignity and pride of honest work, that are rightfully theirs, by being re-trained and employed on said projects; our citizens' posterity will be able to enjoy the fruits of their forefathers, and extend beyond mere Fusion technology. Whereas "bail out/in" will rob us all of a chance to survive and continue the humanistic advance, brought forth by the Golden Renaissance followed by the Peace of Westphalia.
