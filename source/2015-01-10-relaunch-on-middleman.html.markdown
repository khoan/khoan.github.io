Bye Svbtle, say hello to middleman.

I've been looking for an easy to use blogging platform with nice code syntax highlighting. Svbtle fits the bill but net connection is required to blog which slows down the read-eval-print-loop (REPL) to be productive. Enters middleman, a static site generator. It was quick to get started and I have access to Rails front end tech.
