Ah good old Internet Relay Chat, haven't used that in like ever. But found out that it's the best source of help one could get on ruby.

**Setup**

I got a Mac, so I roll with Colloquy. Then connect to irc.freenode.net server and join ruby-lang channel. At first I kept getting warning about not being able to post messages. Turns out you must register with freenode server. So here it is, just type verbatim:

> /msg nickserv help register

Follow instruction, check email then punch in:

> /msg NickServ VERIFY REGISTER khoa **********

Select your password and all good to go.

And I learned that :: is called scope resolution operator from SteveKlanik.
