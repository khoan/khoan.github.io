title: Claim back Snow Leopard speed from Lion

At [Shop2](http://shop2.com), we use the Mac platform heavily for development. But the vim on Mac OSX Lion is just so darn slow, especially autocomplete. One of our engineers has this clever idea of disabling Spotlight. BAM! The vim feels speedier once again.

The only thing Iâ€™m using spotlight is to quickly launch applications. So this is how I configured my Spotlight:

1. System Preferences
2. Spotlight
3. Untick everything except for Applications
4. All done. Now go and enjoy a speedier/more productive vim experience

Cheers.

P.S. Spotlight can be launched by pressing cmd+space
