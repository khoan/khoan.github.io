It's that time again to exercise your Citizenship rights. Here's my submission to [APRA'S CRISIS MANAGEMENT POWERS](http://www.treasury.gov.au/ConsultationsandReviews/Consultations/2017/Crisis-Management-Bill).

RE: APRAâ€™S CRISIS MANAGEMENT POWERS

I humbly request that we avert any crisis by partitioning Commercial Banking from Investment Banking as outlined at http://cecaust.com.au/pubs/pdfs/GSM_20140128_Final_small.pdf, and nationalize Commonwealth Bank of Australia. 

The Government can inject credit at 1-2% simple interest, via said bank, into hiring and training people to realize such projects as the "Bradfield Scheme", the Clarence River Scheme, and Ring Rail in the next 25 years.

Also, it'd be prudent to join the Belt and Road Initiative, and invest into achieving Nuclear Fusion as soon as possible.

Yours.
