People synthesize new ideas in a social context. When people are unbounded by distance, the rate of new ideas being synthesized is increased. Some of those ideas will have profound impact on humanity for the better. In other words, efficient public transport leads to great things.

Opal Runner was created on 10 Mar 2015 to help Sydney siders utilize their public transport network to the fullest extent at mimimal cost. It had a soft launch on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/2zgh6t/unlimited_travel_on_opal_for_less/) and [gumtree](http://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/surry-hills/bus-train-plane/unlimited-travel-on-opal-for-less/1073765483).

The response from the public so far has been underwhelming. Opal Runner's proposed system of using two Opal cards confuses and deters adoption. The success of its intended mission depends on delivering a seamless service to its patrons. Share your thoughts with [@opalrunner](http://twitter.com/opalrunner).
