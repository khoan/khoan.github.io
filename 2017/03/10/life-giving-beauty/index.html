  <h2><a href="./" class="o-article__link">Life giving Beauty</a></h2>
    <p>Civilization is one fierce struggle between life giving Beauty and Ugliness.</p>

<p>When one's soul is deprived of Beauty, life is miserable. Only through deep thought on hard problems towards complete resolution can Beauty be perceived. Thence, an intense euphoric outburst of joy, and a fevor to share immediately that very insight to those around are the powerful effect of Beauty.</p>

<p>The zealots of Ugliness - Aristotle the botanist, Paolo Sarpi, Galileo Galilei, Newton the alchemist, Thomas Hobbes, Jeremy Bentham, Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, Bertrand Russell, H.G. Wells, Milton Friedman, et. al. - have never made that kind of mental breakthrough are miserable, and so indulge on other kinds of pleasure as an expression of that abyss of misery, for they value little their wretched existence beyond mortal life.</p>

<p>Whereas the guardians of Beauty - Solon, Plato of Ancient Greece, Alexander III of Macedon, Jesus of Nazareth (fulfilled Philo of Judea very same humanist mission), Charles I, Ibn-Sīnā, The Maid of Orléans, Giordano Bruno, Filippo Brunelleschi, Nicholas of Kues, Johannes Kepler, Bach, Beethoven, Shakespeare, Leibniz, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Friedrich Schiller, Percy Shelley, Carl Gauss, Bernhard Riemann, Alexander Hamilton, Abraham Lincoln, Henry C. Carey, John Quincy Adams, Franklin Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Krafft Ehricke, Lyndon LaRouche, et. al. - went on to build civilization.</p>

<p>Often resolutions to hard problems appears out of no where - the eureka-why-didn't-I think-of-that moment. The resolutions have always been latent within our Mind, we just "forget" about it, and so our life is spent on recollecting the forgotten knowledge to attain Beauty. The secrets of the Universe, Multiverse, past, present, future is contained within our Mind. All it takes is grit.</p>

<p>Contrary to the fantasy of Charles Xavier, you are the sole master of your thoughts bar none. All shackles are not imposed but rather wilfully chained on by you. Such mental blockers are exhibited as drowsiness in solving hard problems, procrastination to even begin the work, a lack of enthusiasm because there's nothing to look forward to. Such is the Ugliness that pervades.</p>

<p>We live in a world whence no unreasonable thoughts can't be built by courtesy of the aforementioned civilization builders. If you decide to partake in the discoveries of life giving Beauty, the world is your oyster. But beware this game of life is highly addictive. So friends go forth, wallow in hard problems to re-born again a better human.</p>

<p>Be creative!</p>
